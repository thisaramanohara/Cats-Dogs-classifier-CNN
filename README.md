> # cats and dogs classifier using CNN

<br/>

### *I have included both .py and .ipynb files. So you can choose as you wish.*

<br/>


## __NOTE :__ I  have used *VGG16* model. So if you have never used it upto now , then it will be downloaded automatically. If you have used it before , then it will not be downloded.
<br/>

## __NOTE :__ I have commented some important things. I have mentioned how to copy the images of cats and dogs into correct place. So please take care about them.

<br>

*Thank you*
